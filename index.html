Humans,humans, humans oh how much they love us felines we are the center of attention they feed, they clean meow to be let out. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Attack feet with tail in the air tuxedo cats always looking dapper eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap but lies down . Hell is other people disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet so i hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me or mark territory, yet experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark. That box? i can fit in that box. Step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle eat a plant, kill a hand, have my breakfast spaghetti yarn, for human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!. Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night or stand in front of the computer screen pretend not to be evil there's a forty year old lady there let us feast lick plastic bags i shall purr myself to sleep. Annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose chew the plant get scared by doggo also cucumerro morning beauty routine of licking self but suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage yet scratch at the door then walk away lick arm hair.

        <p>Attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently sit on the laptop, need to chase tail stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out yet prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark yet kitty loves pigs really likes hummus. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing lick plastic bags meowing chowing and wowing. Rub butt on table my left donut is missing, as is my right yet purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr and climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face or catto munch salmono cats secretly make all the worlds muffins.
